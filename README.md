Once you are logged in, you will be presented with the faction page:

OathBreaker has two factions - The Triumvate which is represented by the element of water (left) and The Vjarr which is represented by the element of fire (right).

You will always have a chance to switch your faction at any point during the game (hence the name OathBreaker). This can be done with the navbar on the next page:

Once a faction has been selected, you are then presented with characters belonging to your particular faction and can choose any one of them as your character to fight against a randomly selected character from the opposing faction.

Upon selecting your character, the battle begins!
