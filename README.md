## Project Description

OathBreaker is a fantasy medieval-themed fighting game. Users can signup/login by creating an account or using Google. 

OathBreaker is powered by the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) tech stack. The mongoose npm package handles database transactions, mainly for user authentication.

React Router is used to handle component rendering based on the state of the application.

## Factions

OathBreaker has two factions - The Triumvate which is represented by the element of water and The Vjarr which is represented by the element of fire.

The user has the option to select between the two, and can at any time choose to switch to the other faction (hence the name OathBreaker).

#### Technologies

MongoDB, Express, React, Node, CSS3, & Passport
